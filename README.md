## Philosophy -- A note to my future Engineers/Data Scientists of My Company
   * Waiting for this come: Github Codespaces
     * Until Then: Use replit.com to test a github Machine Learning code.
        * If you need more space, buy the hacker membership of 5 bucks/month
        * TODO: Find a way to fast-inference test pretrained models. (Colab does not work so much)
     
    
   * Once the code works and you run without errors, fast-configure Docker-File
     * Write the dockerfile and test the run locally. Pull Docker and test.
     * Set up Github docker action 

   * Machine Learning Part: 
     * Self made data--annotation Tool, inference automation, etc-.. soon
